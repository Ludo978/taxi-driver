# Taxi driver

This is a project I did during my master's degree. With a given simple game named Taxi driver, I implemented a reinforcement learning algorithm to train an agent to play the game. You can tune the parameters of the algorithm to see how it affects the agent's performance.

The file 'main.py' is where the reinforcement learning algorithm is implemented. It's plugged to a simple python API.
'Taxi_Driver.pdf' is the report of the project with explanations and results.
